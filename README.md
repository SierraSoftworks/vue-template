# vue-template [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SierraSoftworks/vue-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SierraSoftworks/vue-template)

**An ultra-lightweight Vue web application template**

This template tries to push the limits of how light a Vue application can
be while still offering an extensive set of features. It tries its best to
avoid having heavy devlopment dependencies (like WebPack and Babel) while
still allowing you to write your code in TypeScript and make use of some of
the great libraries available for Vue.js.

## Features

- TypeScript
- Vue.js
- ElementUI
- Vue-Router
- Vuex
- Material Icons
- Markdown Support
- Browser-Sync
- Builds a Docker container

There are also a number of example filters, components and views to showcase
how to use the template, not to mention a store implementation and API client.

## Development

```bash
npm install # Install everything you need
npm start # Start up Browser-Sync to automatically refresh when changes are made
```
